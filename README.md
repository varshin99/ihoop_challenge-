I am excited to share that my team participated in the Orange Hoops Data Science Challenge, tackling the critical problem of predicting player injuries and creating actionable insights for player health management! 🏀📊

In this challenge, we developed a sophisticated machine learning model using advanced player context and session data to forecast injury risks. Our approach integrated diverse metrics, including heart rate, accumulated acceleration, and exertion levels, to generate a risk score with the potential to revolutionize how injuries are anticipated and prevented in sports.

Working on this project was an incredible opportunity to push the boundaries of analytics and data science. I'm grateful for my amazing teammates—Shashank Guda, Rithika Gurram, and Vishnu Charugundla—whose hard work and collaboration made this achievement possible.

Thank you to the organizers for providing a platform to showcase innovation and contribute to the future of sports science. Looking forward to applying these experiences to new challenges in AI and machine learning!
