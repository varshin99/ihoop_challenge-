I am thrilled to share that my team, Team iHoopInsight, won the Player Injury Category award for our project on injury risk prediction! ðŸŽ‰

Our advanced machine learning model defines an injury risk score for each player, offering immense potential for improving player injury prevention strategies. This project has been an incredible journey, pushing the boundaries of innovation and collaboration.

A huge shoutout to my amazing teammatesâ€”Shashank Guda, Rithika Gurram, and Vishnu Charugundlaâ€”for their hard work and dedication. It was an honor to work alongside such talented individuals.

Grateful for the recognition and looking forward to applying this experience to future challenges in AI and machine learning!
