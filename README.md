I am thrilled to announce that my team, Team iHoopInsight, won First Prize in the Orange Hoops Data Science Challenge for our innovative work on player injury prediction! 🏆🎉

In this exciting competition, we developed an advanced machine learning model leveraging player context and session data to accurately predict injury risks. By analyzing metrics such as heart rate, exertion levels, and accumulated acceleration, we created a risk score with immense potential to revolutionize player health management and injury prevention in sports.

This journey has been nothing short of incredible, filled with opportunities to push the boundaries of analytics and machine learning. A huge shoutout to my amazing teammates—Shashank Guda, Rithika Gurram, and Vishnu Charugundla—for their hard work, dedication, and exceptional collaboration throughout the challenge.

We are grateful to the organizers for this opportunity to showcase our skills and contribute meaningful insights to the future of sports science. Winning this First Prize motivates us to take on new challenges in AI and machine learning with even greater enthusiasm!
